## CITES Captive Trade Assessment

Main commit and work TBD.

### Aim

Spatially and temporally linked assessment of captive records veracity. Ultimately scoring each record in a number of categories to reflect confidence in its veracity.

Will use checks based around CITES CoP18 Res. 17.7 and AC31 Doc.19.1.
